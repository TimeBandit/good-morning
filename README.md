# Good Morning
## Summary
A slack bot to automate my daily greeting to the team.

## Why?
Each morning I greet everyone in the company via slack. 
To save time and have some fun, I decided to automate this.

## How?
It uses the slack API to post a random salutation, quote and emoji.
A scheduled pipeline runs the code each morning.
